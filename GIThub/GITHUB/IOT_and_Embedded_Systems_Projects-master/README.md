# Internet of things (IOT) and Embedded Systems projects
This folder consistes of different embbedded system designs and Internet of things (IOT) implementations using an arduino platform. The projects use different sensors, LED's, motors, Infrared recievers, WIFI Modules, Bluetooth low energy modules and so much more. These projects have different applications such as smart home applications and office applications. 
Arduino has numourous built in functions that implement different functions that can be used easily. The projects listed below use arduino's built in functions for efficient implementations. 
## List of Projects
### Project Set I
1. **LED blink using a button**: 
This project is implementd on the following most widely used microcontrollers made by Texas Instrunments.
    A. MSP430 F5529
    B. MSP430 G2553
2. **Multiple LED Blink**: 
Implemented on the following Microcontrollers
    A. MSP430 F5529
    B. MSP430 G2553
3. **OFF-Board Blink**: 
This project was designed to make use of the microcontroller chip that is found on the MSP430 G2553 lunchpad by separating it and attaching it to a designated circuitry.
4. **Simple LED Blink**:
This project implements a simple blink of an LED every set time interval and can be applied in road side signs and different other equipments.

### Project set II
5. **Button Based Delay**: 
This project is implementd on the following most widely used microcontrollers made by Texas Instrunments.
    A. MSP430 F5529
    B. MSP430 G2553
6. **Button Interrput**: This project implements buttons to trigger an interrupt that inturn would be used for different functionallity such as waking computer from sleep. Iplementd on the following most widely used microcontrollers made by Texas Instrunments.
    A. MSP430 FR2311
    B. MSP430 G2553
7. **Timer A LED Blink**: This project make use of the Timer A module that is found in Msp430 microcontrollers to controll an LED.


### Project set III
8. **Debouncing**: Debouncing occurs during the use of mechanical buttons where a single push of a button sendsa ripple signal to the Input pin. A debouncing circuit is used to remove this rippling signal and prevent unintended results. 
9. **Hardware Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**: This Project uses a hardware PWM to control the brightness of an LED.
This project is implementd on the following most widely used microcontrollers made by Texas Instrunments.
    A. MSP430 F5529
    B. MSP430 G2553
10. **Software Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** :This Project uses a hardware PWM to control the brightness of an LED.
This project is implementd on the following most widely used microcontrollers made by Texas Instrunments.
    A. MSP430 F5529
    B. MSP430 G2553
11.**Remote Controlled Lights**:
This Project implements a multi purpose remote controlled switch where a device that is intended to be controlled would be plugged into an outlet which in return will be powered on or off using a remote control.
 6.**Object Distance detection and Display**:
 This project uses an ultra sonic sensor to measure the relative distance of objects from the sensor and Displays it on an LCD screen.
